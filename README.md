The README you have outlined is already clear and comprehensive. Here are a few suggestions to make it even more effective:

StateScrape

StateScrape is a powerful cybersecurity tool designed to protect against cyber censorship and detect advanced persistent threats (APTs). It combines cutting-edge security tools with machine learning-driven audits to uncover sophisticated attacks such as zero-day exploits, spyware, and malware that often evade traditional defenses.

Key Features

	•	System Information Gathering: Collect detailed system information to monitor and assess vulnerabilities.
	•	Threat Intelligence Analysis: Integrates with open-source threat intelligence platforms for real-time data on emerging threats.
	•	Port Scanning: Identify open ports and services for security audits.
	•	Behavioral Analysis: Monitor system and network activity to detect anomalous behavior indicative of a potential attack.
	•	File Integrity Monitoring: Detect unauthorized changes to critical files using hashing and monitoring techniques.
	•	Memory Analysis: Analyze system memory for signs of exploitation or rootkits.
	•	Machine Learning Anomaly Detection: Identify subtle, previously unseen threats through data analysis and anomaly detection.
	•	Modular Plugin System: Easily extend the tool’s functionality by adding or updating plugins.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StateScrape.git
cd StateScrape


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	(Optional) For Docker deployment:

docker-compose up -d



Usage

StateScrape can be run in different modes to suit various needs. Use the following commands to initiate scans:

python main.py --mode [basic|advanced]

Debug Mode

To run in debug mode and receive detailed logging:

python main.py --mode [basic|advanced] --debug

Configuration

The config.yaml file allows you to customize the behavior of plugins and scan modes. Modify this file to suit your specific requirements:

	•	Add or remove plugins
	•	Customize thresholds for anomaly detection
	•	Configure scan intervals and logging preferences

Plugins

StateScrape uses a modular plugin system, making it easy to extend the tool’s capabilities. Currently available plugins include:

	•	System Info: Gathers detailed information about the system.
	•	Threat Intelligence: Fetches and analyzes threat data from external sources.
	•	Port Scanner: Scans open ports and services.
	•	Behavioral Analysis: Monitors system behavior for anomalies.
	•	File Integrity Monitor: Detects unauthorized file modifications.
	•	Memory Analysis: Analyzes system memory for signs of exploitation.
	•	ML Anomaly Detector: Uses machine learning to detect abnormal activity.

Adding a New Plugin

	1.	Create a new Python file in the plugins directory.
	2.	Implement a run(config: dict = {}) function in your plugin.
	3.	Update the config.yaml file to include your new plugin in the desired scan mode.

Testing

StateScrape includes automated tests to ensure stability and reliability. To run tests:

pytest

Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

StateScrape uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and code validation. Every push and pull request is validated through CI/CD pipelines. The configuration can be found in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file.
