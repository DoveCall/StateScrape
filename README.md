StateScrape

Overview

StateScrape is a cutting-edge cybersecurity tool designed to combat cyber censorship and persistent threats. Developed in response to the increasing use of advanced surveillance technologies by government agencies—often targeting dissidents and whistleblowers—StateScrape aims to empower individuals and organizations by providing a robust platform for threat detection and analysis.

Rationale

In a landscape where sophisticated zero-day exploits are predominantly acquired by state-run agencies with minimal oversight, it is crucial to create tools that level the playing field. StateScrape employs a unique approach by integrating leading cybersecurity tools with advanced machine learning-powered audits. This combination allows users to identify subtle patterns and artifacts left behind by the most sophisticated threat actors, providing insights into their operations and enhancing defensive measures.
